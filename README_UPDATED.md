## Introduction
This lab simulates a **real-world enterprise environment** where:
- Cloud identity is managed via **Microsoft Entra/M365**
- Devices are managed using **Intune Autopilot**
- Security is enforced using **Defender (XDR, EDR, O365 protection)**
- SIEM/SOAR capabilities are implemented with **Azure Sentinel**
- Infrastructure automation is handled with **Terraform + GitHub**
